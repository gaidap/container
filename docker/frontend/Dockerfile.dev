# Run command with volumes to edit code directly:
# sudo docker run -it -p 3000:3000 -v /usr/src/app/node_modules -v ${pwd}:/usr/src/app IMAGE_NAME
# the first volume arg says that we dont want to map this specific folder to the host so it dont get "overriden"
# There is an issue with permissions in regards to Linux hosts (which includes Windows WSL2)
# So the code must be placed in home of the node user and the package.json must be owned by node
